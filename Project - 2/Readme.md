# BranchMaster: The Ultimate Source Control Hub (Design and Implement Source Control)

### Skills Practiced

- Design and implement a source control strategy
- Plan and implement branching strategies for the source code
- Configure and manage repositories

### Project Description

In this project, you'll set up a Git-based source control system using Azure Repos or GitHub, then implement advanced strategies for authentication, branching, and data recovery. You'll use Git hooks for workflow automation and will integrate with Azure Pipelines for CI/CD.

### Azure Services Used

- Azure Repos or GitHub for source control
- Azure Pipelines for CI/CD
- Azure Active Directory for authentication

### Steps

1.  Initial Repository Setup:

    -   Create a new Git repository in Azure Repos or GitHub.
2.  Authentication Strategy:

    -   Implement SSH key-based authentication for the repository.
    -   Optionally, integrate with Azure Active Directory.
3.  Large Files Management:

    -   Integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle large files.
4.  Optimization Strategy:

    -   Implement Git Scalar to speed up operations in your repository.
5.  Workflow Hooks:

    -   Implement pre-commit and post-commit hooks to automate workflows, such as code linting or issue linking.
6.  Branching Strategy:

    -   Create a trunk-based development model with separate branches for features and releases.
7.  Pull Request Workflow:

    -   Implement branch policies for pull requests to enforce code reviews, build validation, and other checks.
8.  Branch Protections:

    -   Implement restrictions on merging to protect important branches like 'main' or 'release'.
9.  Azure Pipelines Integration:

    -   Link your Azure Repos or GitHub repository to an Azure Pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
10. Repository Management:

    -   Configure repository permissions to control access.
    -   Use tags to mark important milestones or versions.
    -   Learn Git commands to recover lost commits or data.
    -   Implement strategies to purge sensitive or unnecessary data from the repository history.
11. Test the Setup:

    -   Simulate a workflow that takes a feature from a feature branch through a pull request, triggers the Azure Pipeline, and merges into the main trunk.
